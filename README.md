# Jest QuickStart

This is a repo used in teaching. It provides a quick way to get started with
Vanilla JavaScript and Jest.

## Getting Started

I recommend forking the repo so that you can practice committing changes.

Clone the repo (if forked, replace `dkarter` with your username):

```bash
git clone git://github.com:dkarter/jest_quickstart.git
```

Install packages:

```bash
cd jest_quickstart/
npm install
```

Run your first test:

```bash
npm test
```
